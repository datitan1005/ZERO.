        <h2>About</h2>
        <p>Our project focuses on repurposing fruit leftovers to make nutritious fruit smoothies. This initiative not only reduces food waste but also provides healthy options for our community. We believe that small changes in our daily habits can lead to significant improvements in food security and environmental sustainability.</p>
        <p>In addition to making fruit smoothies, we also teach people about the importance of reducing food waste and how they can contribute to zero hunger efforts. We encourage everyone to share their experiences, spread the word, and participate in our mission to eradicate hunger.</p>
